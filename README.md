## Simulated Investment and Stock Trading Platform

## Overview

This project is a simulated investment and stock trading platform designed to allow users to:
- View real-time market data (price, charts, and volume)
- Perform virtual trades (buy/sell stocks)
- Manage a portfolio and track performance
- Analyze stock data with integrated tools

The platform is built with a scalable architecture and focuses on performance, real-time updates, and security. Users can simulate trading with virtual money, get real-time stock data, and visualize market trends through data charts.

## Features

- **Real-time Market Data**: Fetch and display live stock prices, market trends, and historical data.
- **Virtual Trading**: Users can buy and sell stocks with virtual money, allowing them to practice trading without financial risk.
- **Portfolio Management**: Track the performance of stocks in the user's portfolio, view historical trades, and monitor gains and losses.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JWT tokens.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for stock analysis, including candlestick charts and volume analysis.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: A powerful front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with real-time data updates for stock prices.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances maintainability in large-scale applications.
  
### Backend
- **Node.js**: Handles API requests and WebSocket connections for real-time updates.
- **Express**: A minimalist web framework for building RESTful APIs.
  
### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores user data, transaction history, and market data. It’s a highly scalable and reliable relational database.

### Real-time Data
- **WebSocket (Socket.IO)**: Enables real-time updates of stock prices and notifications for market changes.

### Financial Data API
- **Alpha Vantage**: Provides real-time stock data via a simple and robust API.

### Security
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication system to ensure user privacy.
- **HTTPS**: All data transmissions are encrypted to prevent any security vulnerabilities.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **PostgreSQL**: Install PostgreSQL for database operations. You can find the installation guide [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-platform.git
   cd trading-platform
   ```
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
  ```bash
  # Install backend dependencies
  cd backend
  npm install
  ```
  ```bash
  # Install frontend dependencies
  cd ../frontend
  npm install
  ```
3. Set up PostgreSQL database:
Create a database and configure the connection in the backend .env file.

4. Run the application:
  ```bash
  # Start the backend
  cd backend
  npm start
  ```

# Start the frontend
